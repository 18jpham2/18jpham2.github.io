          <td>This story had two conflicting identities, one where it would parody the character of tyler1 in a funny way and one where it would accurately resemble a game of league. I used the website draw.io to create a treemap of all of the branches of the story. I used and learned about python modules and using functions to simplify the tree for the story. A problem I encountered while working on this was that I had already finished writing the story in python and I now had to account for user error, leading me to lazily seperate the story into their functions. I'm not happy with the story because the idea behind it sucks and I used it just to spite my friend Nethan, who wanted to use it. I wish I had spent more time on this so I could properly flesh out the identity of the story and its content. I didn't enjoy any stories in particular and I would correct all the faults I mentioned before if I had a chance to do it again.</td>
